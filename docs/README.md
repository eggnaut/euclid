## Features:
Automatically generates quadratic equations given endpoints and number of equations. The endpoints are used to determine the range of _a_, _b_, and _c_ (in a quadratic equation).

**Note:** This software has not been tested on Windows or Linux and may not work on them at all.

## Setup:
First, you'll have to install the dependencies for euclid:
1. Download the repository files and source code.
2. Open the `euclid` folder
3. Run/execute the `dependencies.py` file
4. You're ready to use euclid!

## Usage:
To generate quadratic equations for practice:
1. Download the repository files and source code.
2. Open the `euclid` folder
3. Run/execute the `gui.py` file
4. Follow the instructions!

If you want to use your command line (for example Terminal on macOS):
1. Download the repository files and source code.
2. Open the `euclid` folder
3. Run/execute the `eqGenerator.py` file
4. Follow the instructions!


## Building:
**Note:** This is build script only works and builds for macOS and Linux.
**Note:** This script has not been tested on Linux or Windows.
If you want to build euclid into an application yourself:
1. Download the repository files and source code.
2. Open the `euclid` folder
3. Run/execute the `euclidBuild.py` file
4. Look inside the `docs` folder. There should be a `dist` folder. Open it.
5. Inside the `dist` folder are two builds of euclid, one is an `.exe` and the other is an app.
